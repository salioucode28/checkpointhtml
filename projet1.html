            Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the
            20th century. Born in Ulm, Germany in 1879, he developed the theory of relativity — a groundbreaking
            framework that transformed our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation, E = mc²,
            became a symbol of scientific genius and revolutionized modern physics.

            Driven by curiosity and a deep sense of wonder, Einstein combined creativity with scientific rigor. In 1921,
            he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which paved the
            way for quantum theory.

            Beyond science, Einstein was a passionate advocate for peace, civil rights, and humanitarian values. His
            legacy continues to inspire generations of thinkers, dreamers, and innovators across the globe.
